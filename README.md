# WPGraphQL Smart Cache (BETA)

Do you want your API data _fast_ or _accurate_? With WPGraphQL Smart Cache, you can have both.

WPGraphQL Smart Cache is a free, open-source WordPress plugin that provides support for [caching](./docs/ca) and cache invalidation of WPGraphQL Queries.

> _**NOTE:** To get the most out of this plugin, we recommend using GET requests with Network Caching, which requires your WordPress install to be on a [supported host](./network-cache.md/#supported-hosts)._

## Overview

WPGraphQL has essentially become the standard when it comes to building headless WordPress experiences.

The flexibility and tooling around GraphQL is attractive, but it can come at a cost.

### Performance Issues

_"The fastest code is the code which does not run" - [Robert Galanakis](https://daveredfern.com/no-code/)_

WPGraphQL is optimized for run-time performance by using [DataLoader](https://www.wpgraphql.com/docs/wpgraphql-vs-wp-rest-api#dataloader-and-the-n1-problem) methods and other techniques to reduce run time execution cost, but the fact is that WPGraphQL is built on top of WordPress and respects the WordPress application layer â€“ including actions, filters, authentication rules, and the WordPress database structure.

This means that anytime a WPGraphQL request is executed against WordPress (much like any type of request made to WordPress) there is a cost, and the cost can sometimes be problematic.

One of the fastest ways to load WordPress, is to prevent WordPress from being loaded at all!

This is no different for WPGraphQL.

### Solving the Performance Issues

This is where WPGraphQL Smart Cache comes in.

WPGraphQL Smart Cache has integrations with a multiple layers of caching to provide users of WPGraphQL with both fast and accurate data managed in WordPress.

The over-simplification of WPGraphQL Smart Cache, is to capture the results of GraphQL Requests, store the response in a cache, and use the cached response for future requests instead of executing the query and all of its resolvers at each request.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

This quick start guide will cover the basics of [Object Caching for WPGraphQL Queries](./docs/object-cache.md) and [Cache Invalidation](./docs/cache-invalidation.md).

> _If you're WordPress install is on a [supported host](./docs/network-cache.md#supported-hosts), you will benefit more from Network Caching and we recommend you head over to the [Network Cache Quick Start](./docs/network-cache.md#quick-start) instead of this quick-start. If you're not on a supported host, tell your host to check out our [hosting guide](./docs/network-cache.md#hosting-guide) and carry on with this Quick Start guide below._

### Install & Activate

If you haven't already installed and activated the WPGraphQL Smart Cache plugin, follow the [Install & Activation guide](./docs/installation.md), then come back here.

### Enable WPGraphQL Object Cache

With the latest versions of WPGraphQL and WPGraphQL Smart Cache installed and activated, navigate to the "WPGraphQL > Settings" page in your WordPress dashboard, then select the "Cache" tab.

![Screenshot of the WPGraphQL Smart Cache "Cache" Settings](./docs/images/object-cache-enable.png)

From this settings page, check the "Use Object Cache" setting and click "Save Changes".

This will activate the object cache functionality for WPGraphQL Queries.

### Enable WPGraphQL Tracing (optional)

While testing, you can enable "WPGraphQL Tracing" to see data about how long (in microseconds) each field in a GraphQL request takes to resolve.

To enable WPGraphQL Tracing, navigate to the "WPGraphQL > Settings" page and select the "WPGraphQL General Settings" tab.

Check the "Enable GraphQL Tracing" option, and set the "Tracing Role" to "Any". This will let us see the trace data in public requests as we test the caching functionality.

![Screenshot of enabling Tracing in WPGraphQL Settings](./docs/images/enable-graphql-tracing.png)

> **NOTE:** When you're done testing, consider disabling tracing as it is intended to be a debug tool, and it does add weight to the responses client applications download from the WPGraphQL Server.

### Execute a query using the GraphiQL IDE

Next, navigate to the "GraphQL > GraphiQL IDE" screen in the WordPress dashboard.

Paste the following query in the IDE.

```graphql
{
  posts {
    nodes {
      id
      title
      uri
    }
  }
}
```

Execute the query by pressing the play button.

> _**NOTE:** To ensure your GraphiQL IDE is not executing as a logged in user, toggle the button to the right of the "Play" button. If a green status indicator is showing, requests will be authenticated and will bypass the cache. Public, non-authenticated requests will be served from the cache._

You should see results similar to the following screenshot:

![Screenshot of uncached query](./docs/images/graphiql-execute-first-query.png)

If you inspect the response, you will notice the "graphqlSmartCache" key with a nested "graphqlObjectCache" key under the "extensions" payload.

If the value of the `graphqlObjectCache` key is empty, the request was _not_ served from cache.

If you [enabled GraphQL Tracing](#enable-wpgraphql-tracing-optional), take a look at the `extensions.tracing" payload.

You will see a "duration" field, which is the overall time the query took to resolve (in microseconds).

Take note of this value. For me, it was: `"duration": 23271,`

Additionally, you will see a lot of data about each field that was resolved. You don't need any of this data, just take note of its presence.

### Execute the Query Again

Execute the same query again (still as a non-authenticated request).

This time, you should observe the `graphqlSmartCache.graphqlObjectCache` key will have data returned.

You should see a payload similar to the following:

```json
 {
  "data": {
    ...
  },
  "extensions": {
    ...
    "graphqlSmartCache": {
      "graphqlObjectCache": {
        "message": "This response was not executed at run-time but has been returned from the GraphQL Object Cache",
        "cacheKey": "9cc3bbab3abfcc618153b3e9a3df403c2408f1007abe35aeaec0e2d640fb1233"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This means that the request was served from the WPGraphQL Object Cache instead of executing all of the resolvers for every field.

If you [enabled GraphQL Tracing](#enable-wpgraphql-tracing-optional), take a look at the `extensions.tracing" payload again.

This time, you should see a lower value for the duration field. For me, the value was `"duration": 9933`. Nearly 3x faster!

Additionally, you will note that the `resolvers` field under tracing is empty. This is because the data was returned from the object cache and no resolvers were executed!

### Invalidate the Cache

Go ahead and execute the same query a few more times, and note that it continues to be served from the cache.

In order to balance "Fast" and "Accurate" data, WPGraphQL Smart Cache listens to events in WordPress, and when relevant events occur, the relevant cache(s) are evicted, and fresh data is served.

In another browser tab, navigate to the "Posts" page and "quick edit" the most recent post, adding a period to the title.

![Screen recording showing a quick-edit of a post's title](./docs/images/quick-edit-post-title.gif)

Then, back in the browser tab with the GraphiQL IDE open, execute the query again.

The query should be a "cache miss" and we should see the accurate, updated title, and the `graphqlSmartCache.graphqlObjectCache" output under "extensions" should be empty.

## Known Issues

### Batch Queries

There are currently some issues around Batch Queries. If you use Batch Queries in your client application, we will need more time before we have WPGraphQL Smart Cache working for you.

If you use Batch Queries in your application and would like to make use of WPGraphQL Smart Cache, let us know in the WPGraphQL Smart Cache slack channel or Github Discussions so we can learn more about your use cases.

### Missing Invalidation Hooks

Currently, weâ€™re missing invalidation hooks related to Settings (options).

That means cache for queries that ask for Settings (i.e General Settings, Discussion Settings, etc) will not be invalidated/evicted automatically when actions related to those things occur.

You can read more about the nuances of supporting settings here: [#158](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-smart-cache/issues/158)

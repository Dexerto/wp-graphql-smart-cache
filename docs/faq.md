# Frequently Asked Questions

## What's the price of this plugin?

This plugin is free!

## Is the plugin on Composer or the WordPress.org repo?

We plan to put the plugin on Composer and WordPress.org at some point, but currently it's only available on [Github](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-smart-cache/releases/latest).

## Does this plugin only work on WP Engine?

This plugin was built to work in WordPress with as many WordPress hosts.

The [Network Cache](./network-cache.md) functionality does require some work from the host to support.

We've partnered with WP Engine to get this functionality working for WP Engine customers, but we hope to see more hosts support GraphQL caching and Cache Invalidation at the network cache level.

We have a [hosting guide](./network-cache.md#hosting-guide) for hosts that are interested in providing support.
